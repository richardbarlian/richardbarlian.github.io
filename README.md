## A personal website for showcasing my achievements from 2019

## ⚠️ **<span style="color:red">WARNING</span>** ⚠️
### **This website is still in development and has lots of bugs, particularly for those using a mobile device.**
---
### Expect new updates such as new achievements, bug fixes or improvements in the near future.
### Until now (18-12-2021), there are only achievements in 4 subjects (Math, Science, Computer Science and English). In the future, I wish to add subjects from non-academic subjects such as Music or Art.
